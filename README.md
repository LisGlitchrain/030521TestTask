Program a module that works with user's wallet which allow:
1. Receive information with debit of available currencies.
2. Change value of certain currency.
3. Save and load current state of wallet.

Test app must:
1. Display count of coins and crystals that user has. 
2. Allow to set and increment current balance each of currencies.
3. Save and load data to PlayerPrefs (string saving specific to Unity) by certain key, to a text file with certain name and path, to a binary file with certain name and path, (optional) to server with given params.

Task will be estimated by following SOLID principles, suitable using of programming patterns for solving certain tasks. Particular attention should be paid to simplicity and convenience of us–µ API of the module, relationship between classes,and also extensibility of current solution (addition new currency types, saving methods, serialization).
